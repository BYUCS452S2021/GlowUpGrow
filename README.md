# GlowUpGrow
Hello everyone!

This project came to me last year when grocery shelves were empty of any fresh produce.
The explosive growth of human society is largely attributed to the development of agriculture, which allowed some individuals in a social group to produce more food than they themselves could eat.
That is theorized to have enabled technologicla advances with people being able to spend time on things other than getting food for survival.

This project is aiming to push human societal growth toward a post scarity future where having (fresh) food is not at risk in situations of financial/societal distress.
This will allow humanity to move forward away from an existance focused on survival to one aimed at growth and invention.

This project for this class is working on a little part of that. 

For the entire project, peoples'/households' info needs to be stored:
   - Shipping address
   - Payment info
   - Order history 
      - Kits
      - Plants
      - Bots
      - Accessories
   - "Green thumb" score (success rate which would allow recommendations of plants of a suitable difficulty)
   - Username/Login & Password
   - Contact info
   
For the project, info needs to be stored about all available plants:
   - Ideal growing conditions
      - Air temperature
      - Light requirements
      - Soil requirements
          - Acidity
          - Elemental/molecular nutrient preferences
          - Water level/moisture
          - Oxygen levels
          - Temperature
      - Humidity
      - Space requirements
      - Air disturbance requirements
   - Troubleshooting methods (if __ happens, __ is what you should do)
   - Harvesting schedule
   - Expected stages of growth
   - Edibility information
       - Edibility at various life stages
       - Nutrient profile
       - Hazards, as applicable
       
 For each person/household, the garden's info needs to be stored:
   - Kits/physical facilities they have
   - Which plants they have in which plots
   - For each plant they have:
       - Age of plant
       - Soil info in plot (see soil requirements in plant info, above)
       - Health issues
       - Harvestable indicator
   - Maintenance info for automated systems
       - Servo "health"
       - Track "health"
       - Sensor "health"
       - Light node "health"
       - Nutrient resource levels
       - GardenerBot info
           - Location
           - Non-completed task queue
           - Current task info
           - Completed tasks
           - Uncompletable tasks
            
I'm committed to this project longer-term, and am aiming at taking the principle to market within the next couple years.
I understand that likely isn't the case for y'all, but let me know if you'd be interested in working on the idea past this term!
