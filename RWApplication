Hello! My name is Reagan Weston, and I would love to join this project. I love the idea of an automated at-home planting system. I've always wanted to have more plants (both functional and aesthetic!), but I have a hard time keeping track of their care, both because I forget and because I don't always know what they need. Having an app to keep track of plant growth and to tell me what I need to do to take care of it would be amazing. This is an app that I would love to use, and I think it would be useful for a lot of people.

I'm not sure what exactly the MVP of this app would entail, or what your implementation plan is. My thinking is that this concept would work best as a mobile app, as that would allow the app to send reminders and to be more readily available to users in their day-to-day lives. I have experience developing in Java on Android, but I am open to using other languages and platforms.

Again, I love the idea of this app, and I would be excited to join this project. Feel free to reach out to me on Slack, or email me at raygunrocks@gmail.com. Thank you
