Hello, I’m James Peterson,

I think that your application seems intriguing, and potentially fun to work with. I have some front end and back end experience, 
although not intensive, and have a solid grasp of the basic concepts behind them (as well as experience with designing and creating them).
I’m interested in working on the database for this project, and working on combining together all the various tables and information in a
way that makes an effective DB.

Looking at the specs you have laid out for the project, your tables seem quite intensive and large - I think that we could definately get to work on that - although
we might want to prioritize the most important information first, and then work on what else we can later on. I have time to work on it indepth this semester, so I'd
be happy to work with other members schedules as well.

I took a CSBuisness class as well, so although I may not be able to continue working on this past this semester, I'd be happy to use the knowledge I gained in that class
to help this project progress closer to something you can sell in the future. Let me know how things work out with applications, thanks.
